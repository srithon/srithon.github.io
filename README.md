  <p>
    My name is Sridaran Thoniyil and during the 2018-2019 robotics season, I was one of the programmers on 750Z, one of the two "shadow teams." The shadow teams consisted of freshmen in the robotics program, and they acted as learning grounds so that the new people could have the opportunity to learn on their own instead of watching established teams operate on their own.<br/>Outside of robotics, my hobbies include playing the trumpet and expanding upon my computer science knowledge.

<h2 align = "center">Personal Project - CodeEncryptor</h2>
<p>This was an application I wrote during the robotics season to encrypt code before publishing it to our public GitHub repository. While that was the original intent, it became clear that using it for that purpose would have been unnecessary and inconvenient. However, the application can still be used to encrypt other files.<br/>At the moment, the method of encryption is not secure enough to be used for important documents, as I came up with it only as a learning experience. However, I am working towards replacing it with an industry-standard encryption algorithm such as AES-256.<br/></p>
